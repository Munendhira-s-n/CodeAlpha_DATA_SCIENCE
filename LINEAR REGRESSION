Insurance Charges Prediction using Linear Regression
Predicting insurance charges using Linear Regression model.

Overview
This project utilizes Linear Regression to predict insurance charges based on various demographic and health-related attributes of individuals.

Dataset
The dataset (insurance.csv) used in this project includes the following columns:

age: Age of the individual
sex: Gender of the individual (0 = male, 1 = female)
bmi: Body mass index (BMI) of the individual
children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
smoker: Smoking status of the individual (0 = no, 1 = yes)
region: Region where the individual resides (encoded as dummy variables for modeling purposes)
charges: Insurance charges billed to the individual
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values (if any), encoding categorical variables (sex, smoker, region), and splitting data into training and testing sets.
Model Development: Implementing Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
Visualization: Plotting actual vs predicted charges and residuals analysis.
Files
insurance.csv: Raw dataset used for analysis and model training.
linear_regression.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
