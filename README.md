## 1. Titanic Classification

### Overview
This project aims to predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It analyzes the Titanic dataset to build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

### Key Steps
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
- Feature selection and model training using Random Forest Classifier.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating effective prediction of survival outcomes.

## 2. Linear Regression

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting insurance charges using Linear Regression. It analyzes a dataset containing attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, etc., to predict the insurance charges billed to individuals.

### Key Steps
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
- Implementing Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
- Evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

### Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:
- MAE: XX
- MSE: XX
- RMSE: XX
- R2 Score: XX

## 3. A/B Testing Analysis

### Overview
This project involves analyzing the results of an A/B test to evaluate the effectiveness of a new website design. It explores whether there is a statistically significant difference in user engagement metrics between the old and new designs.

### Key Steps
- Formulating hypotheses and defining metrics for analysis.
- Performing statistical tests (e.g., t-test, chi-square test) to compare results.
- Interpreting findings and drawing conclusions based on statistical significance.

### Results
Statistical analysis indicates a significant improvement (or lack thereof) in user engagement metrics with the new website design.
